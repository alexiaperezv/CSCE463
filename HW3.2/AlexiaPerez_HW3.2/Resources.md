Resources Used for Homework 3.1:
- Skeleton Code & Logic from --> CSCE 463-500, Spring 2022 HW 3.1 PDF
- Set decimal precision in printf C/C++ --> http://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/cs170/printf/
- Measuring elapsed time for a function in C++ --> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/measure-execution-time-with-high-precision-in-c-c/
- Winsock initializer function --> heavily based on code from file "dnsCLient.cpp" in my HW 2 submission
- Create UDP socket --> heavily based on code from file "socket.cpp" in my HW 1.2 submission
- DNS lookup to check if IP is valid --> heavily based on code from file "socket.cpp" in my HW 1.2 submission
- Send SYN packet --> heavily based on code from file "dnsClient.cpp" in my HW 2 submission
- Select function for receiving data --> heavily based on code from file "dnsClient.cpp" in my HW 2 submission
- Resetting timer for select (to use in while-loop) --> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21743231/winsock-selects-timeout-on-listening-socket-causing-every-subsequent-select-c
- Receiver Header --> CSCE 463-500, Spring 2022 HW 3.1 PDF
- recvfrom function --> heavily based on code from file "dnsClient.cpp" in my HW 2 submission
- rtt calculation --> CSCE 463-500, Spring 2022 HW 3.1 PDF
- SenderSocket Close() function --> code is mostly copied & pasted from my SenderSocket::Open(...) function

**NOTE: the logic for most of the Open and Close functions is (almost) the same as logic in the files (my own) where the code was taken from.**

Resources Used for Homework 3.2:
- A lot of my code was replicated from what I had already implemented in part 1
- I also used some official Microsoft documentation as reference when writing threads in the code
- I used the PDF for part 3 of this homework as a reference so that I would write more productive code for the future implementation of part 3 to be as manageable as possible
